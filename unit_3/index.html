	<h2>Oneida Lake Fishing</h2>
	<h3>May-June</h3>
	<p> The abundance of walleye in Oneida Lake is amazing. This is a no pressure, relaxing, fishing trip.</p>
	<p>Our 22' Pathfinder Bay Boat is perfect for jigging up Oneida Lake walleye. We can take up to 4 guests and a typical day would be your 3 fish limit of eyes, with many more released. Then, throw in some jumbo perch, white bass, along with a few smallies, and you have the makings of an action packed fun, easy trip on the water. Spinning and casting rods and all bait and lures are provided.</p>
