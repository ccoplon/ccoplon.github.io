			<h2>Salmon River and Tributaries</h2>
			<h3>September - November</h3>
			<p>The season begins in early September when King Salmon start to migrate up the Salmon River in Pulaski, NY. High Adventure Sportfishing targets trophy Kings with fly rods and bright colored flies. Once we have sufficient water flow, we put the drift boat into service and use high action plugs to take these aggressive, territorial fish. Salmon will also strike plugs.Spend a day with High Adventure Sportfishing and we will show you how to catch Salmon from bank or boat.</p>
			<p>By mid-October, large numbers of egg-gobbling Steelhead and Brown Trout start to enter the rivers and migrate through the winter months. A float trip aboard our heated drift boat is a great way to learn the river and expierence its beauty.</p>
			<p>By mid-March, the Steelhead are spawning. As these fish drop back to the lake, they feed ferociously to regain strength and body weight.</p>
			<p>Between April and May, action can be spectacular. These fish will take all the offerings: plugs, spinners, eggs, and live bait.</p>

		<h2>Florida Backwaters</h2>
		<h3>December - February</h3>
			<p>I now spend three months a year plying some of the most fertile water in southwest Florida. I am docked in Pine Island, which is just west of Fort Myers. On this trip, we fish for Snook, Reds, Sheepshead, Mackerel, snapper, sharks, trout and anything else that swims! The Florida sunshine and calm waters make for easy fishing and almost everything you catch you can eat. Walk the beautiful beaches and keep an eye out for dolphins, manatees, sting-rays, and birds. Let us plan that special winter get-a-way for you, your family, and your friends.</p>
